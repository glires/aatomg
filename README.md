# aatomg - unlock the secrets of microproteins

This suite of programs performs reverse translation of peptide sequences to generate potential microgene nucleotide sequences. It then explores frameshift mutations in the coding genomic sequences, unveiling novel proteins. Ideal for researchers studying protein evolution, gene discovery, and functional genomics.
